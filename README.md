# Autonomous-Marine-Drone
The Autonomous Marine Patrol Drone is an innovative unmanned surface vehicle (USV)
designed to perform surveillance, monitoring, and safety operations in aquatic environments
without direct human intervention. This project aims to design and develop a compact, energy-
efficient, and intelligent drone boat capable of navigating water bodies autonomously while
transmitting real-time data. By integrating embedded systems, sensors, and renewable energy
sources, the
drone demonstrates how modern technology can reduce human risk and improve operational
effectiveness in marine environments.
